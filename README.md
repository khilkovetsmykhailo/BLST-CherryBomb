💣What is Cherrybomb?
Cherrybomb is a CLI tool that helps you avoid undefined user behavior by validating your API specifications.

Our CLI tool is open source, enabling support from both the OpenAPI and Rust communities.


⛏How does it work?

It takes in an OAS file, runs a series of checks on it to make sure everything is on par with the OAS, and outputs a detailed table with any alerts found, guiding you to the exact problem and location to help you solve it quickly.

It can also take in your logs and check them for business logic flaws.
